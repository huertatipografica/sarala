Sarala > Latin + Devanagari font
===================

This file provides detailed information on the *Sarala* font
software.

This information should be distributed along with the Sarala fonts and any
derivative works.

### Basic Font Information
Sarala is a devanagari font based on Telex free font.

Telex is a humanist sans serif conceived to be a web font with nice legibility at normal text sizes. Originally based on grid fitting shapes it became a multi-purpose typeface with low contrast, open counter forms, wide proportions and a touch of freshness.

Designed by Andrés Torresi for [Huerta
Tipográfica](<http://www.huertatipografica.com>).
